# The Future of Glassmorphism

Glassmorphism is more than just a trend; it's a way to add depth and hierarchy to your UI.

## Why it works:
1.  **Translucency**: Creates a sense of layered content.
2.  **Hierarchy**: Blurred backgrounds keep the focus on the foreground.
3.  **Vibrancy**: Colors pop through the glass panels.

### Code Example:
\`\`\`css
.glass-panel {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}

# building My Own Portfolio

In a world of Squarespace and Wix, why spend weeks coding every div?

- **Control**: Every pixel is where I want it.
- **Learning**: Deep diving into React and Node.js.
- **Ownership**: No subscription fees, just code.
